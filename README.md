# SeniorProject
This repository is my senior project, web API.

This web API was implemented followed by Associate Professor, Ph.D., Chatchawit Aporntewan's instruction and belonged to the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University.

The desired objectives of this system development are to help the coordinators to keep tracking senior project progression and integrate assignments submission channels and contact into one place.
